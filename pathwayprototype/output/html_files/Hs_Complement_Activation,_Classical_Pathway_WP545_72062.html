<h1>Complement Activation, Classical Pathway</h1><div class="text-content short-text">The complement system is a biochemical cascade that helps, or √¢¬Ä¬úcomplements√¢¬Ä¬ù, the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the immune system called the innate immune system that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. The Classical pathway of activation of the complement system is a group of blood proteins that mediate the specific antibody response. [source: Wikipedia)
