<h1>DNA Damage Response (only ATM dependent)</h1><div class="text-content short-text">This is the second pathway out of two pathways which deals with DNA damage response. It has two central gene products (ATM and TP53) which are connected with the first DNA damage response pathway.
In this pathway is only one source of DNA damage induction because most sources and their induction and involvement in the process in DNA damage are mentioned in the first DNA damage response pathway.
If it is not mentioned different, the processes take place in the cell cytoplasm.
The goal of this second pathway is to mention more gene products and changes in the cell condition through the DNA damage response pathway and at the same time to keep it clearly arranged
