<h1>Integrated Pancreatic Cancer Pathway</h1><div class="text-content short-text">An integrated pathway model which displays the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among the relevant proteins for pancreatic cancer. This pathway is a collection of different mechanistic protein pathways integrated together using relevant proteins for Pancreatic Cancer attained through multiple high quality databases. The different colors and different show that these proteins are from the same respective pathways. As with the proteins these protein pathways were also gathered from extremely high quality database, such as KEGG. The green lines indicate that it is up regulating while the red lines show that the protein is being inhibited, or in other words down regulated.
